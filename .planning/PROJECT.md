# AI Safety Talent Network (ASTN)

## What This Is

A career command center for AI safety talent. Individuals maintain living profiles and get matched to opportunities with acceptance probability estimates and personalized "what to do next" recommendations. Local orgs get a self-maintaining CRM as a byproduct. The core insight: people keep profiles updated when they get real value back, not because you ask them to.

## Core Value

Individuals get enough value from smart matching + recommendations that they keep profiles fresh -- this is the flywheel that makes everything else work.

## Current Milestone: v1.6 Career Actions

**Goal:** Add LLM-generated personalized career actions — self-directed things a person can do right now to advance their AI safety career, beyond posted positions. Inspired by the "Stop Applying And Get To Work" philosophy.

**Target features:**

- 3-5 personalized career actions per person, generated by Claude Haiku
- Action types: replicate papers, find collaborators, start orgs, identify gaps, volunteer, build tools, teach/write, develop skills
- Generated alongside opportunity matching (same trigger) + refreshable on demand
- Directed but general (e.g., "Find a mech interp paper to replicate — your ML skills + interp interest make this high-value")
- Displayed on opportunities page (violet accent, visually distinct) + matches page (own section)
- Interactions: save, dismiss, mark as in-progress, mark as done
- Completion flow: mark done → enrichment chat (seeded with action context) → extraction review → apply to profile → re-run matching + generate new actions
- Dismissed actions can resurface in future generations if profile evolves

## Current State

**Shipped:** v1.5 Org Onboarding & Co-working (2026-02-03)

v1.5 added org self-onboarding with application flow and admin approval, co-working space management with capacity tracking and custom forms, member direct booking with flexible hours, lightweight guest access with quick account creation and org approval, profile consent for attendee visibility, and admin dashboard with bookings calendar, attendance history, and utilization stats.

**Active milestone:** v1.6 Career Actions

**Tech stack:** Convex + TanStack Start + React 19 + shadcn/ui + Claude Sonnet 4.5/Haiku 4.5

**Codebase:** ~118,000 lines TypeScript, ~500 files

### Active

- [ ] LLM-generated personalized career actions (3-5 per person)
- [ ] Action generation alongside matching + on-demand refresh
- [ ] Action interactions: save, dismiss, in-progress, done
- [ ] Completion flow: done → enrichment chat → extraction → profile update → re-run
- [ ] Violet-accented action UI on opportunities and matches pages

### Out of Scope

- Application tracker -- v2, after proving the hook works
- Rejection analysis -- v2, requires application history
- Pre-fill applications -- v2, retention feature not acquisition
- Collaborator matching -- v2+, complex feature
- Reading/course tracking system -- v2+, simple recs first
- "Insist" escalation (multi-channel nudges) -- v2+
- Cross-org discovery -- v2+
- Sophisticated career pathing with milestones -- v2+
- Mobile Tauri native app -- deferred, separate milestone

## Context

**Current state:** v1.5 shipped 2026-02-03. Org onboarding and co-working spaces complete. Platform is feature-rich for BAISH pilot.

**Known tech debt:**

- OAUTH-03: Access tokens returned to client in Tauri flow (low risk, short-lived tokens, sandboxed WebView)
- Zod validation in shadow mode (needs real LLM output data before enforcing)
- 3 matching concurrency edge cases (empty first batch, re-queried opportunity list, no concurrency guard)
- No test files (CI test step passes vacuously)
- @ts-nocheck in batchActions.ts (Convex action type inference workaround)

**Launch plan:** Workshop-based onboarding where members create profiles (via upload, paste, or AI chat) and get immediate matches during the session.

**v1.6 design context:** Career actions are inspired by the "Stop Applying And Get To Work" philosophy — most valuable AI safety career moves are self-directed (replicating papers, finding collaborators, identifying gaps, volunteering). Actions should feel like a coach's advice, not a job listing.

**Three-sided network:**

1. Individuals -- get matching + recommendations, keep profiles updated
2. Local orgs -- get CRM that maintains itself (members update their own profiles)
3. Opportunity posters -- get better candidates without changing workflow (v2, passive benefit from aggregation for now)

## Constraints

- **Pilot scope**: BAISH first, 50-100 profiles before expanding
- **Opportunity data**: Dependent on 80k and aisafety.com aggregation working
- **LLM-based**: Acceptance probability and recommendations are LLM-estimated, not historical data (yet)
- **Tech stack**: Convex for backend, TanStack Start for frontend
- **No vector search**: Programmatic context construction for LLM calls instead of embeddings
- **Models**: Claude Sonnet 4.5 (quality/reasoning tasks) + Haiku 4.5 (bulk/fast operations)
