## Current

**v1.6 Career Actions** - Phases 35-36

Add LLM-generated personalized career actions -- self-directed things a person can do right now to advance their AI safety career, beyond posted positions. Actions generate alongside matching, display with violet accent, support save/dismiss/in-progress/done interactions, and complete into the enrichment system for a virtuous profile-growth cycle.

| Phase                                   | Goal                                                  | Plans | Requirements                                                  |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 35 - Generation, Display & Interactions | Users see personalized career actions and manage them | TBD   | 17 (GEN-01 to GEN-07, DISP-01 to DISP-05, ACTN-01 to ACTN-05) |
| 36 - Completion Loop                    | Done actions feed back into profile enrichment        | TBD   | 4 (COMP-01 to COMP-04)                                        |

### Phase 35: Generation, Display & Interactions

**Goal:** Users receive personalized career actions generated by Claude Haiku, see them as violet-accented cards on the matches page and dashboard, and can save, dismiss, track, and manage their actions across regeneration cycles.

**Depends on:** Nothing (first phase in v1.6; builds on existing matching pipeline from v1.0)

**Requirements:** GEN-01, GEN-02, GEN-03, GEN-04, GEN-05, GEN-06, GEN-07, DISP-01, DISP-02, DISP-03, DISP-04, DISP-05, ACTN-01, ACTN-02, ACTN-03, ACTN-04, ACTN-05

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. User with a complete profile sees 3-5 personalized career actions after matching runs, each referencing specific elements from their profile (not generic advice)
2. Actions display as violet-accented cards on the matches page in a "Your Next Moves" section, visually distinct from match tier cards, with type badges and personalized reasoning
3. User can save, dismiss, mark in-progress, and mark done on any action, and these states persist across page loads
4. Refreshing matches regenerates actions while preserving any actions the user has saved, marked in-progress, or marked done
5. 1-2 top actions appear as preview cards on the dashboard alongside top matches

**Plans:** TBD

### Phase 36: Completion Loop

**Goal:** Users who complete career actions can optionally tell ASTN about what they did, feeding new experience into their profile through the existing enrichment system, which then triggers updated matches and fresh actions.

**Depends on:** Phase 35

**Requirements:** COMP-01, COMP-02, COMP-03, COMP-04

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. User marking an action as done sees two clear paths: "Tell us about it" (opens enrichment chat) or "Just mark done" (skips enrichment)
2. Choosing "Tell us about it" opens an enrichment chat pre-seeded with the completed action's context, so the conversation starts relevant
3. Extracted profile updates from the completion chat go through the existing review UI where the user approves changes before they apply
4. After profile updates are applied, user is prompted to refresh matches, which regenerates both matches and actions reflecting the updated profile

## Progress

**Execution Order:** 35 -> 36

| Phase                                  | Plans Complete | Status      | Completed |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------- | ----------- | --------- |
| 35. Generation, Display & Interactions | 0/TBD          | Not started | -         |
| 36. Completion Loop                    | 0/TBD          | Not started | -         |
