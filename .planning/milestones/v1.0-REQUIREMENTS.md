## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Real-time messaging | Scope creep, moderation burden, spam risk |
| Social feed / content posting | EA Forum already serves this need |
| Gamification beyond completeness | Inappropriate for mission-driven context |
| Video interviews / assessments | High friction, not core to matching |
| Mobile app | Web-first for pilot, mobile later |
| Salary data / negotiation tools | Sensitive data, not core to v1 value prop |
