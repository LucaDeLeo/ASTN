# Milestone v1.0: MVP

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-01-18
**Phases:** 1-6
**Total Plans:** 21

## Overview

This roadmap delivered the ASTN pilot for BAISH (50-100 profiles). We started with opportunity aggregation to prevent cold start, then built user-facing features in dependency order: auth, profiles, matching, and finally engagement/org features. Each phase delivered a coherent, verifiable capability that unlocked the next.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation + Opportunities

**Goal**: Opportunities exist and are browsable before users arrive (cold start prevention)
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Plans**: 4 plans

- [x] 01-02: Opportunity data model and admin CRUD
- [x] 01-03: Opportunity aggregation (80K Hours + aisafety.com adapters)
- [x] 01-04: Opportunity browsing UI (list, detail, search/filter)

**Details:**
- Requirements covered: OPPS-01, OPPS-02, OPPS-03, OPPS-04, OPPS-05, OPPS-06
- Success criteria: User can view/search opportunities, aggregation working, admin can manage

- Completed: 2026-01-17

### Phase 4: Matching

**Goal**: Users receive smart matches with explanations and actionable recommendations
**Depends on**: Phase 3 (profiles exist), Phase 1 (opportunities exist)
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 04-01: Match data layer (schema, internal queries/mutations)
- [x] 04-02: Match compute engine (prompts, LLM action, public queries)
- [x] 04-03: Matches UI (list page, detail page, components)

**Details:**
- Requirements covered: MATCH-01, MATCH-02, MATCH-03, MATCH-04
- Success criteria: Tier-based matching, explanations, probability estimates, recommendations

### Phase 5: Engagement + Org

**Goal**: Users stay engaged through notifications; BAISH has visibility into their members
**Depends on**: Phase 4 (matching), Phase 3 (profiles)
**Plans**: 6 plans

Plans:
- [x] 05-01: Email infrastructure + schema (Resend component, templates)
- [x] 05-02: Notification scheduling (timezone-aware batch processing)
- [x] 05-03: Notification preferences UI (/settings page)

### Phase 6: Polish + Tech Debt (GAP CLOSURE)

**Goal**: Close audit gaps and clean up tech debt before pilot launch
**Depends on**: Phase 5 (all features complete)
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 06-01: Navigation and auth wrapper fixes (add /matches link, admin auth guard)
- [x] 06-02: Tech debt cleanup (Phase 04 VERIFICATION, invite button, dead code removal)

**Details:**
- Gap closure phase addressing v1-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md findings
- Success criteria: /matches link visible, admin routes protected, Phase 04 verified, invite button works
- Completed: 2026-01-18

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

- Cold start prevention — build opportunity pipeline before user features
- Programmatic context construction for LLM matching (no vector search)
- Convex + TanStack Start + Claude Sonnet 4.5/Haiku 4.5 stack
- Tier labels (great/good/exploring) instead of percentages for encouraging tone
- First user to join org becomes admin automatically

**Issues Resolved:**

- Route conflicts with pathless layouts — switched to shared header components
- Convex "use node" runtime limitations — separated actions from queries/mutations
- TanStack Router typed links — used params object instead of template strings

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

- `@ts-nocheck` in batchActions.ts (Convex action type inference workaround)
