# v1.1 Profile Input Speedup - Milestone Audit

**Milestone Goal:** Reduce friction in profile creation by letting users upload CVs/PDFs or paste text, have LLM extract structured data, auto-fill form, user reviews, then enrichment chat fills gaps.

**Audited:** 2026-01-19T14:45:00Z
**Status:** PASSED

## Tech Debt

Minimal tech debt accumulated. All items are informational (INFO severity).

### Phase 7: File Upload Foundation

- INFO: `test-upload.tsx` contains TODO comment "Remove after Phase 7 verification complete"

### Phase 8: LLM Extraction Core

- INFO: `test-upload.tsx` contains TODO comment "Remove after Phase 8 verification complete"
- INFO: `useExtraction.ts` contains "placeholder" in a comment (legitimate explanation, not a stub)

### Phase 9: Review & Apply UI

- INFO: `test-upload.tsx` contains TODO comment noting test page is temporary

**Total: 4 informational items across 3 phases**

These TODO comments are expected - they mark the test page for removal once development is complete. No blocking tech debt.

### Phase 7 (Visual/Animation)

- Drag-and-drop visual feedback (reveal animation)

- Accept/reject/edit interaction test
- Apply flow test
- Data persistence test

### Phase 10 (Full Flows)

## Authentication Protection

All sensitive mutations verified to require authenticated user:

- `generateUploadUrl` - Line 11 checks auth
- `saveDocument` - Line 33 checks auth
- `applyExtractedProfile` - Line 382 checks auth

## Type Alignment

Types are consistent across phases:

- `ExtractedData` type matches between frontend hooks, components, and Convex schema
- `AppliedData` type matches between ResumeExtractionReview and applyExtractedProfile mutation args
