# Milestone v1.1: Profile Input Speedup

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-01-19
**Phases:** 7-10
**Total Plans:** 13

## Overview

Reduce friction in profile creation by letting users upload CVs/PDFs or paste text, have LLM extract structured data, auto-fill form, user reviews, then enrichment chat fills gaps.

## Phases

### Phase 7: File Upload Foundation

**Goal**: Users can upload PDFs or paste text with clear feedback and error handling
**Depends on**: Phase 6 (v1.0 complete)
**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 07-01: Backend infrastructure (schema + upload mutations)
- [x] 07-02: Upload hook and utilities (state machine + progress)
- [x] 07-03: Upload zone UI (drag-drop, preview, progress bar)
- [x] 07-04: Text paste zone + verification checkpoint

**Details:**
- Requirements covered: UPLD-01, UPLD-02, UPLD-03, UPLD-04, UPLD-05, UPLD-06
- Success criteria: drag-drop, file picker, progress indicator, 10MB limit display, error messages
- Key patterns: Collapsible reveal animation, soft validation

### Phase 8: LLM Extraction Core

**Goal**: System extracts structured profile data from uploaded documents using Claude Haiku 4.5
**Depends on**: Phase 7 (upload infrastructure exists)
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 08-01: Extraction foundation (schema + prompts + skill matching)
- [x] 08-02: Extraction actions (PDF + text extraction with retry)
- [x] 08-03: Extraction UI (progress, error handling, test integration)

**Details:**
- Requirements covered: EXTR-01, EXTR-02, EXTR-03, EXTR-07
- Success criteria: extract name/email/location/education/work, suggest skills, handle errors
- Key patterns: Discriminated union state machine, grid overlay transitions

### Phase 9: Review & Apply UI

**Goal**: Users can review, edit, and confirm extracted data before it saves to their profile
**Depends on**: Phase 8 (extraction produces data to review)
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 09-01: Review foundation (types, state hook, apply mutation)
- [x] 09-02: Review UI components (field cards, expandable entries, main container)
- [x] 09-03: Integration + verification checkpoint

**Details:**
- Requirements covered: EXTR-04, EXTR-05, EXTR-06, INTG-02
- Success criteria: preview all fields, inline editing, gap identification, auto-fill profile
- Key patterns: Default acceptance, auto-expand textarea, review-then-apply flow

### Phase 10: Wizard Integration

**Goal**: Profile creation offers multiple seamless entry points with context-aware follow-up
**Depends on**: Phase 9 (review UI exists)
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 10-01: Entry point UI components (step indicator, entry selector, LinkedIn tip)
- [x] 10-02: Wizard orchestration (state machine, post-apply summary)
- [x] 10-03: Route integration & verification checkpoint

**Details:**
- Requirements covered: INTG-01, INTG-03, INTG-04
- Success criteria: 4 entry points, context-aware enrichment, manual entry fallback
- Key patterns: Discriminated union wizard state, chatFirst auto-greeting

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Claude Haiku 4.5 for extraction (fast, cheap ~$0.001/resume, vision capable)
- Extract-then-discard for privacy (no document retention)
- Explicit user review required before applying extracted data
- Default acceptance in review UI (reject unwanted vs accept each)
- 0.7 similarity threshold for fuzzy skill matching
- 4-way entry point wizard (upload, paste, manual, chat-first)

**Issues Resolved:**
- Profile creation friction (now ~30 seconds with upload vs ~5 minutes manual)
- Multi-item section editing (expandable entry cards for education/work history)
- Entry point confusion (clear 4-option selector with descriptions)

**Issues Deferred:**
- DOCX support (PDF covers 90%+ of resumes)
- OCR for scanned PDFs (Haiku Vision handles most cases)
- Confidence scores for extracted fields (v2 feature)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- test-upload.tsx temporary route (should be removed after verification)
- TODO comments marking test page for removal
