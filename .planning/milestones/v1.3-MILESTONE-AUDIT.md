# Milestone v1.3 Audit: Visual Overhaul

**Audited:** 2026-01-20T22:30:00Z
**Status:** Tech Debt (all requirements met, non-critical items need review)

## Executive Summary

v1.3 Visual Overhaul **achieved its core goal**: transforming ASTN from generic shadcn/ui to a warm, memorable visual identity. All 33 requirements are satisfied. The design system foundation (tokens, fonts, animations) is solid and properly integrated.

**Key Achievement:** The warm coral-based visual system is now global—cards have warm shadows, buttons squish, pages have smooth transitions, and dark mode uses intentional warm undertones.

**Gap Found:** Some secondary pages (settings, attendance, org admin) still use cold `bg-slate-50` backgrounds and generic typography. This is **coverage debt**, not a system failure—the visual system works, it just wasn't applied everywhere.

## Scores

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Requirements | 33/33 | All TYPO, ATMO, MOTN, COMP, PAGE requirements satisfied |
| Phases | 4/4 | All phases completed and verified |
| Integration | 12/17 | 12 exports properly connected, 5 pages missing warm treatment |
| E2E Flows | 3/5 | Core flows work, 2 partial (some pages have cold backgrounds) |

## Phase Verification Status

| Phase | Status | Verified | Notes |
|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| 17: Foundation & Tokens | ✓ Passed | 2026-01-20 | 5/5 criteria verified |
| 18: Core Visual Polish | ✓ Passed | (code verified) | Missing VERIFICATION.md, code inspection confirms complete |
| 19: Motion System | ✓ Passed | 2026-01-20 | 5/5 criteria verified |
| 20: Polish & Integration | ✓ Passed | 2026-01-20 | 4/4 criteria verified |

**Note:** Phase 18 lacks a VERIFICATION.md file but all success criteria are met (GradientBg exists, shadow-warm used across 11 files, warm backgrounds on all specified pages).

## Integration Status

### Connected Exports (12 working integrations)

| Export | From Phase | Used By |
|--------|------------|---------|
| GradientBg | 18 | 6 main routes (home, matches, opportunities, profile, orgs) |
| font-display token | 17 | 28+ headings |
| shadow-warm tokens | 17/18 | card.tsx (base + hover + active) |
| ease-gentle, ease-spring | 17 | card.tsx transitions |
| ThemeProvider | 20 | __root.tsx wraps app |
| useTheme | 20 | theme-toggle, use-dot-grid-style |
| ThemeToggle | 20 | auth-header.tsx |
| AnimatedCard | 19 | MatchTierSection, index.tsx |
| Button active:scale-[0.97] | 19 | Global via button.tsx |
| Card hover lift | 19 | Global via card.tsx |
| View transitions | 19 | router.tsx + app.css |
| Dark mode tokens | 20 | app.css .dark selector |

### Missing Connections (5 gaps — coverage issues)

1. **Settings page** uses `bg-slate-50` instead of GradientBg
2. **Attendance page** uses `bg-slate-50` instead of GradientBg
3. **Org pages (8+ files)** use `bg-slate-50` throughout
4. **35+ headings** use `font-bold` instead of `font-display`
5. **Login page** uses inline gradient (works but duplicates GradientBg logic)

## E2E Flow Status

| Flow | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Visit page → warm background | ⚠️ Partial | Core pages work, settings/org pages use cold bg |
| Hover card → lift with shadow | ✓ Complete | Global via card.tsx |
| Click button → squish | ✓ Complete | Global via button.tsx |
| Navigate → smooth transition | ✓ Complete | View Transitions API enabled |
| Toggle dark mode → no flash | ✓ Complete | SSR cookie-based detection |

## Tech Debt Summary

### From v1.3 (Visual Overhaul)

**Phase 18: Core Visual Polish**
- 8+ routes use `bg-slate-50` instead of GradientBg or dot grid
  - `/routes/settings/route.tsx`
  - `/routes/profile/attendance.tsx`
  - All `/routes/org/$slug/*` pages (8 files)
- 35+ headings use `font-bold` instead of `font-display font-semibold`
- Org admin section entirely missed visual overhaul

**Phase 17: Foundation & Tokens**
- `animate-fade-in`, `animate-slide-up`, `animate-scale-in` defined but AnimatedCard uses tw-animate-css utilities instead (low priority, tokens exist for future use)

### Pre-existing (from earlier milestones)

- `@ts-nocheck` in `convex/emails/batchActions.ts` — Convex action type inference workaround (documented)
- `src/routes/test-upload.tsx` has TODO to remove after Phase 8 verification

## Recommendation

**The milestone is complete.** The visual system works end-to-end for all core user journeys. The gaps found are **coverage issues** (pages that weren't updated) rather than **integration failures** (broken connections).

**Options:**
1. **Complete now, track coverage in backlog** — Accept that settings/org admin pages have cold backgrounds as tech debt for v1.4
2. **Quick polish pass** — Update remaining pages to use GradientBg before completing (estimated: 10 files)

The core value proposition of v1.3 ("warm, memorable visual identity") is delivered. Settings and org admin pages are lower-visibility areas that can be addressed later.
