# Requirements: v1.4 Hardening

**Defined:** 2026-01-31
**Core Value:** Individuals get enough value from smart matching + recommendations that they keep profiles fresh

## v1.4 Requirements

37 requirements for security hardening, bug fixes, and code quality improvements identified in the comprehensive codebase review.

### Authentication & Authorization

- [x] **AUTH-01**: Enrichment sendMessage action requires authenticated user who owns the profile
- [x] **AUTH-02**: Enrichment getMessagesPublic query requires authenticated user who owns the profile
- [x] **AUTH-03**: Enrichment extractFromConversation action requires authenticated user who owns the profile
- [x] **AUTH-04**: OAuth exchangeOAuthCode validates redirectUri against an allowlist of permitted origins
- [x] **AUTH-05**: getCompleteness query requires authentication (or deprecate in favor of getMyCompleteness)
- [x] **AUTH-06**: Shared requireAuth helper standardizes authentication checks across all endpoints

### OAuth Security

- [x] **OAUTH-01**: Tauri mobile OAuth flow implements PKCE (S256 code_challenge)
- [x] **OAUTH-02**: OAuth state parameter is validated on callback (stored in Tauri Store, not memory)
- [~] **OAUTH-03**: OAuth access tokens are not returned to the client (handled server-side only) -- _deferred to post-pilot per CONTEXT.md_
- [x] **OAUTH-04**: Console.log statements removed from OAuth flow in production

### LLM Safety

- [x] **LLM-01**: Profile data in LLM prompts is wrapped in XML delimiters separating data from instructions
- [x] **LLM-02**: Input length limits enforced on profile fields sent to LLM calls
- [x] **LLM-03**: LLM tool_use responses validated at runtime with Zod schemas (matching, engagement, extraction)
- [x] **LLM-04**: Zod schemas use permissive mode (.passthrough(), .optional()) to avoid silent match failures

### Bug Fixes

- [x] **BUG-01**: Growth areas aggregated (not overwritten) across matching batches
- [x] **BUG-02**: Date conversion uses Date.UTC() instead of new Date() in profiles.ts
- [x] **BUG-03**: Navigation calls wrapped in useEffect in redirect components (profile, matches, settings)
- [x] **BUG-04**: Engagement override expiration checked in query handlers (not just daily compute)

### Performance

- [x] **PERF-01**: N+1 query in programs.ts resolved (batch participant counts)
- [x] **PERF-02**: N+1 query in attendance/queries.ts resolved (batch event/org lookups)
- [x] **PERF-03**: N+1 query in emails/send.ts resolved (batch user lookups)
- [x] **PERF-04**: Rate limiting added between matching batch API calls

### Code Quality

- [x] **QUAL-01**: CI pipeline via GitHub Actions (lint + typecheck + build on push/PR)
- [x] **QUAL-02**: Pre-commit hooks via husky + lint-staged (lint + format on commit)
- [x] **QUAL-03**: Dual lockfile resolved (remove package-lock.json, keep bun.lock)
- [x] **QUAL-04**: .env.example documenting all required environment variables
- [x] **QUAL-05**: test-upload.tsx route removed
- [x] **QUAL-06**: Dead code removed (\_STEP_LABELS in ProfileWizard)
- [x] **QUAL-07**: Browser alert() replaced with toast notification in admin form
- [x] **QUAL-08**: Error handling standardized (toast for user-facing, structured logging for server-side)
- [x] **QUAL-09**: Timezone validation uses IANA database check (not just "/" presence)

### Accessibility

- [x] **A11Y-01**: Interactive org div converted to button with keyboard support and ARIA role
- [x] **A11Y-02**: Form validation errors linked to inputs via aria-describedby
- [x] **A11Y-03**: Client-side password validation with inline feedback before submission
- [x] **A11Y-04**: Drag state indication uses icon/text in addition to color

### Visual Polish

- [x] **VIS-01**: GradientBg applied to settings, attendance, and org admin pages
- [x] **VIS-02**: 35+ headings updated from font-bold to font-display
