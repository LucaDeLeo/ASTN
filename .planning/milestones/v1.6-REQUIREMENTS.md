# Requirements: ASTN v1.6 Career Actions

**Defined:** 2026-02-10
**Core Value:** Individuals get enough value from smart matching + recommendations that they keep profiles fresh

## v1.6 Requirements

### Generation

- [x] **GEN-01**: User receives 3-5 personalized career actions generated by Claude Haiku based on their profile
- [x] **GEN-02**: Each action belongs to one of 8 types (replicate, collaborate, start_org, identify_gaps, volunteer, build_tools, teach_write, develop_skills)
- [x] **GEN-03**: Actions are generated alongside opportunity matching (same trigger, chained via scheduler)
- [x] **GEN-04**: User can refresh actions on demand (same trigger as match refresh)
- [x] **GEN-05**: Action generation incorporates match gaps and growth areas for targeted advice
- [x] **GEN-06**: Generated actions span at least 3 of 8 types to ensure variety
- [x] **GEN-07**: Each action includes a `profileBasis` field citing which profile signals drove the recommendation

### Display

- [x] **DISP-01**: Actions display as violet-accented cards visually distinct from coral/emerald/blue match tiers
- [x] **DISP-02**: Each action card shows personalized reasoning ("why this for me") referencing specific profile elements
- [x] **DISP-03**: Actions appear in a dedicated "Your Next Moves" section on the matches page
- [x] **DISP-04**: 1-2 top actions appear as preview cards on the dashboard alongside top matches
- [x] **DISP-05**: Action cards show type badge (e.g., "Replicate", "Collaborate") with appropriate icon

### Interactions

- [x] **ACTN-01**: User can save an action for later
- [x] **ACTN-02**: User can dismiss an action (hidden now, can resurface in future generations if profile evolves)
- [x] **ACTN-03**: User can mark an action as in-progress
- [x] **ACTN-04**: User can mark an action as done (triggers completion flow)
- [x] **ACTN-05**: Regeneration preserves saved, in-progress, and done actions (only replaces suggested/active actions)

### Completion Flow

- [x] **COMP-01**: Marking action as done offers two paths: "Tell us about it" (enrichment chat) or "Just mark done"
- [x] **COMP-02**: "Tell us about it" opens enrichment chat seeded with completed action context (title, description, type)
- [x] **COMP-03**: Extraction from completion chat goes through existing review UI for user approval
- [x] **COMP-04**: Profile update from completion triggers match recomputation and action regeneration

## Future Requirements (Deferred to v1.7+)

- **BRIDGE-01**: Related career actions shown on match detail pages (action-to-match bridging)
- **OPP-01**: Actions displayed on opportunities page alongside posted positions
- **RESURF-01**: Intelligent dismissed action resurfacing based on profile change analysis
- **STEPS-01**: Optional step-by-step breakdown for complex actions

## Out of Scope

| Feature                                               | Reason                                                                  |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Specific resource links (papers, URLs, program names) | High hallucination risk in AI safety's small community — destroys trust |
| Gamification (points, streaks, badges)                | Trivializes existential risk work, creates perverse incentives          |
| Action deadlines or time estimates                    | False pressure for self-directed work                                   |
| Social/public sharing of actions                      | Performance pressure, dilutes personal nature                           |
| Continuous progress bars on actions                   | Actions are discrete (done/not done), not gradual completion            |
| Detailed step-by-step project plans                   | ASTN is a career coach, not Asana                                       |
| Auto-recompute on completion                          | Research recommends manual refresh prompt to avoid cascade waterfall    |
