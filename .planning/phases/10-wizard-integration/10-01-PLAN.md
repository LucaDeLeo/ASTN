<objective>
Create the entry point UI components for the profile creation wizard.

Purpose: Users need a clear, visually appealing way to choose how to start their profile creation - whether by uploading a resume, pasting text, filling forms manually, or starting with the AI chat. These components are the first thing users see in the wizard flow.

Output: Two reusable components - WizardStepIndicator (shows wizard progress) and EntryPointSelector (shows 4 entry options)

Key context from user decisions:

- Stacked list layout with primary option highlighted at top
- Upload PDF is the primary/recommended option
- Include "How to get your LinkedIn PDF" link under upload option
- Each option has label + one-line description (no time estimates)
- Step indicator at top: "1. Input -> 2. Review -> 3. Enrich"
  </context>

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create WizardStepIndicator component</name>
  <files>src/components/profile/wizard/WizardStepIndicator.tsx</files>
  <action>
Create a 3-step progress indicator component showing the wizard flow.

Steps:

1. Input - Where user chooses entry method
2. Review - Where user reviews extracted data (only appears if extraction happened)
3. Enrich - Chat-based profile enhancement

Props interface:

- currentStep: "input" | "review" | "enrich"
- showReviewStep?: boolean - Whether to show review step (hidden for manual/chat-first)

Visual design:

- Horizontal layout with steps connected by lines/arrows
- Current step highlighted with primary color
- Completed steps show checkmark
- Future steps muted
- Use Lucide icons (CircleDot for current, CheckCircle2 for complete, Circle for future)
- Responsive: stack vertically on mobile if needed

Use existing project patterns:

- Tailwind CSS classes
- cn() utility for conditional classes
- shadcn/ui styling conventions
  </action>
  <verify>Component renders without errors, shows correct step state based on currentStep prop</verify>
  <done>WizardStepIndicator displays 3 steps with proper highlighting based on currentStep prop</done>
  </task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create EntryPointSelector component</name>
  <files>src/components/profile/wizard/EntryPointSelector.tsx</files>
  <action>
Create the entry point selection component with 4 options in a stacked list.

Props interface:

- onSelect: (entryPoint: "upload" | "paste" | "manual" | "chat") => void
- disabled?: boolean

Entry points (in order, top to bottom):

1. **Upload PDF** (PRIMARY - highlighted styling)
   - Icon: Upload or FileText
   - Label: "Upload your resume"
   - Description: "We'll extract your info automatically"
   - Below this card: LinkedIn PDF tip (collapsible)

2. **Paste text**
   - Icon: ClipboardPaste
   - Label: "Paste text"
   - Description: "Copy from LinkedIn or your resume"

3. **Manual entry**
   - Icon: FormInput or PenLine
   - Label: "Fill out manually"
   - Description: "Enter your information step by step"

4. **Chat-first**
   - Icon: MessageSquare
   - Label: "Chat with AI"
   - Description: "Let our AI guide you through the process"

LinkedIn PDF tip (under upload option):

- Collapsed by default: "How to get your LinkedIn PDF"
- On expand, show brief instructions:
  - Go to your LinkedIn profile
  - Click "More" button under your name
  - Select "Save to PDF"
- Use ChevronDown/ChevronUp for toggle
- Small text styling, muted color

Visual design:

- Card-style options with hover states
- Primary option (upload) has emphasized border/background (primary/10 bg, primary border)
- Other options have standard card styling
- All options clickable as full card (not just button)
- Use shadcn Card component as base
- Gap between cards, rounded corners
  </action>
  <verify>Component renders all 4 options, clicking each calls onSelect with correct entry type, LinkedIn tip expands/collapses</verify>
  <done>EntryPointSelector displays 4 entry options with upload highlighted, LinkedIn tip works, onSelect fires correctly</done>
  </task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. Both components import and render without TypeScript errors
2. WizardStepIndicator correctly highlights the current step
3. EntryPointSelector shows all 4 options in correct order
4. Upload option is visually distinguished as primary
5. LinkedIn PDF tip expands and collapses
6. Clicking any entry option calls onSelect with correct value
</verification>

<success_criteria>

- WizardStepIndicator.tsx exists and exports WizardStepIndicator
- EntryPointSelector.tsx exists and exports EntryPointSelector
- Both components follow project patterns (Tailwind, cn(), shadcn/ui)
- TypeScript compiles without errors
  </success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/10-wizard-integration/10-01-SUMMARY.md`
