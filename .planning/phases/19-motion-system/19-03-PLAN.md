<objective>
Verify all motion system behaviors work correctly through visual testing.

Purpose: Motion is best verified by seeing it in action. This checkpoint ensures hover effects, staggered entrances, button feedback, and page transitions all work as designed.

Output: User confirmation that motion system is complete.

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>
Complete motion system including:
- Card hover lift (2px up) with shadow transition
- Button press squish (97% scale) with smooth return
- Staggered card entrance animations on list pages
- Page transitions (crossfade) when navigating between routes
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Start the dev server if not running: `bun run dev`
2. Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser

**Test 1: Button Press Feedback**
- On the landing page, click the "Browse Opportunities" button
- Observe: Button should compress slightly (squish) on press, then return

**Test 2: Card Hover Lift**
- Navigate to /matches or /opportunities
- Hover over any card
- Observe: Card should lift slightly (2px) and shadow should intensify

**Test 3: Staggered Entrance (Opportunities)**
- Navigate to /opportunities
- Observe: Cards should fade in one after another with slight upward slide
- Each card appears ~50ms after the previous (creates a wave effect)

**Test 4: Staggered Entrance (Matches)**
- Navigate to /matches (requires profile with matches)
- Observe: Match cards in each tier stagger in

**Test 5: Page Transitions**
- Click from home to /opportunities
- Click from /opportunities to a specific opportunity
- Click back button
- Observe: Pages should crossfade smoothly (250ms) rather than instant swap

**Test 6: Reduced Motion (Optional)**
- Enable "Reduce motion" in your OS accessibility settings
- Repeat tests above
- Observe: Animations should be minimal/instant
  </how-to-verify>
