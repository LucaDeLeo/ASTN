# Feature Research: Org CRM, Events & Engagement (v1.2)

**Domain:** Org CRM, event management, attendance tracking, engagement scoring
**Researched:** 2026-01-19
**Confidence:** MEDIUM-HIGH

## Executive Summary

Research into membership CRM platforms, community management software, and event attendance tracking reveals clear patterns for what field-building organizations expect. The key insight: orgs ALWAYS build a homegrown CRM (spreadsheets/Airtable), and members NEVER keep it updated because there is no value exchange. ASTN's unique opportunity is making individuals the source of truth (they update their own profiles for personal value) while giving orgs a CRM view of that data.

## Table Stakes (Orgs Expect These)

Features local AI safety hubs (BAISH, Oxford OAISI, Cambridge, Stanford) assume any "org CRM" will have.

| Feature                      | Why Expected                                                                               | Complexity | Notes                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Member directory/list**    | Every CRM has a searchable list of members; Oxford OAISI tracks this in Airtable today     | LOW        | Must show: name, contact info, career stage, areas of interest. Filter by engagement level, program affiliations              |
| **Profile viewing**          | Org admins need to see full member profiles to understand their community                  | LOW        | Privacy-controlled: members opt-in to org visibility. Must be clear what orgs can see                                         |
| **Basic member stats**       | "How many members do we have? What's the breakdown by career stage?"                       | LOW        | Dashboard with counts, simple charts. Reference: every AMS (Association Management Software) has this                         |
| **Event creation & listing** | Orgs host events (coworking, reading groups, roundtables); need to create and publish them | MEDIUM     | Title, description, date/time, location (physical or virtual), capacity, RSVP                                                 |
| **Event notifications**      | Members need to know about upcoming events relevant to them                                | LOW        | Email is primary channel; must respect member preferences for frequency/types                                                 |
| **RSVP/registration**        | Standard for any event management; members indicate attendance intention                   | LOW        | Simple "Going / Not Going / Maybe" or registration with waitlist for capacity                                                 |
| **Attendance tracking**      | Post-event record of who actually attended; core to any CRM                                | MEDIUM     | Manual check-in or self-report ("Did you attend?"). Oxford OAISI tracks attendance for coworking, reading groups, roundtables |
| **Member contact info**      | Name, email, LinkedIn are baseline; Oxford OAISI also tracks personal website              | LOW        | Pull from user profile; org-specific fields (like org-internal Slack handle) can be added                                     |
| **Export data**              | Org admins need to get data out for reporting, grants, etc.                                | LOW        | CSV export of member list, attendance records. Every AMS and CRM offers this                                                  |

## Differentiators (Competitive Advantage)

Features that make ASTN's org CRM uniquely valuable vs. homegrown spreadsheets/Airtable.

| Feature                                | Value Proposition                                                                                              | Complexity          | Notes                                                                                                                                                                   |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Self-updating profiles**             | Members update their OWN profiles (because they get matching value), not relying on org admin to chase updates | LOW (already built) | Core ASTN insight. Homegrown CRMs fail because members don't update; ASTN solves this by giving members personal value                                                  |
| **LLM-computed engagement levels**     | Automatically score member engagement based on attendance, profile activity, etc.                              | MEDIUM              | Reference: iMIS, Association Analytics, Rhythm Software all offer engagement scoring. Typical categories: "Highly Engaged", "Moderately Engaged", "At Risk", "Inactive" |
| **Admin override for engagement**      | LLM-computed engagement with human override capability                                                         | LOW                 | Admins know context LLM doesn't (e.g., member is highly engaged but traveling). Override with notes                                                                     |
| **Post-event feedback collection**     | "Did you attend?" prompts after events with optional feedback                                                  | MEDIUM              | 42% higher response rate when sent within 2 hours (Typeform research). Keep it SHORT: attendance confirmation + 1-2 optional questions                                  |
| **Attendance history on profiles**     | Member profiles show their event attendance history                                                            | LOW                 | Oxford OAISI tracks this manually in Airtable. Automatic in ASTN. Helps orgs understand member engagement patterns                                                      |
| **Geography-based org suggestions**    | "You're in Buenos Aires? Join BAISH!"                                                                          | MEDIUM              | Surface orgs based on member location. Searchable org directory with location filtering                                                                                 |
| **Configurable event notifications**   | Members control which event types they hear about and how often                                                | MEDIUM              | Prevent notification fatigue. Options: all events, specific types, weekly digest only, none                                                                             |
| **Invite links for orgs**              | Easy member acquisition: "Join our org via this link"                                                          | LOW                 | Standard pattern (Circle, Mighty Networks, Discord). Link auto-affiliates member with org                                                                               |
| **Org-specific affiliations tracking** | Track which org programs a member participates in (e.g., Oxford's ARBOx, TARG, TAISR)                          | MEDIUM              | Custom fields per org. Flexible enough for different org structures                                                                                                     |
| **"Wants to meet" networking**         | Members indicate interest in meeting others; surface mutual matches                                            | MEDIUM              | Oxford OAISI tracks this. Can be simple tags: "mentorship", "collaboration", "career advice"                                                                            |

## Anti-Features (Deliberately NOT Building)

Features that seem valuable but create problems or scope creep.

| Anti-Feature                                       | Why Requested                                    | Why Problematic                                                                            | Alternative                                                                                     |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Real-time chat/messaging**                       | "Make networking easy"                           | Creates spam burden; becomes LinkedIn 2.0; requires moderation; distracts from core value  | Event-based connections; "wants to meet" matching; org can share Slack/Discord links            |
| **Full event ticketing/payments**                  | "All-in-one event platform"                      | Scope creep; Luma/Eventbrite/Lu.ma do this well; most AI safety events are free            | Link to external ticketing; focus on attendance tracking not ticket sales                       |
| **Complex event check-in (QR codes, NFC, badges)** | "Professional event management"                  | Over-engineered for community events; 50-person reading group doesn't need conference tech | Simple self-report: "I attended" button or admin check-in list                                  |
| **Public member directory**                        | "Help people find each other"                    | Privacy concerns; members didn't consent to public exposure; reduces trust                 | Org-specific directories (members control per-org visibility)                                   |
| **Gamification (attendance streaks, badges)**      | "Gamify engagement"                              | Feels manipulative in mission-driven context; creates perverse incentives                  | Celebrate milestones authentically (e.g., "10th event attended") without leaderboards           |
| **Detailed engagement analytics for members**      | "Show me my engagement score"                    | Creates anxiety; score is for org planning not member judgment                             | Keep engagement scoring admin-only; show members their attendance history (factual, not scored) |
| **Multi-level marketing / referral tracking**      | "Track member referrals"                         | Inappropriate for community orgs; creates weird dynamics                                   | Simple "How did you hear about us?" on join, no tracking chains                                 |
| **Automated re-engagement campaigns**              | "Win back inactive members"                      | Spammy; violates member preferences; orgs should engage personally                         | Flag "at risk" members for personal outreach by org admin                                       |
| **Complex role hierarchies**                       | "Chapter admins, regional leads, etc."           | Over-engineered for current scale; creates permission complexity                           | Simple: member vs. org admin. Add roles only when orgs actually need them                       |
| **Event series / recurring event management**      | "Weekly reading group should auto-create events" | Complexity for edge cases (holidays, cancellations); manual is fine for current scale      | Template events that can be quickly duplicated; consider automation in v2 if requested          |

## Engagement Scoring Model

Based on research from Association Analytics, iMIS, Rhythm Software, and ChangeEngine.

### Scoring Dimensions

| Dimension                        | Weight | Signals                                                           | Notes                                                           |
| -------------------------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Event attendance**             | HIGH   | Events attended / Events invited, Recency of attendance           | Primary signal for local org engagement                         |
| **Profile completeness**         | MEDIUM | % of profile filled out, Profile update recency                   | Indicates investment in platform                                |
| **RSVP reliability**             | MEDIUM | (Attended / RSVPd Yes) ratio                                      | Distinguishes between optimistic RSVPers and reliable attendees |
| **Program participation**        | MEDIUM | Affiliations with org programs (reading groups, mentorship, etc.) | Org-specific customization needed                               |
| **Communication responsiveness** | LOW    | Email open rates (if tracked)                                     | Secondary signal; don't over-weight                             |

### Suggested Engagement Tiers

| Tier                   | Criteria                                                              | Org Action                                       |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Highly Engaged**     | Regular attendance (3+ events/quarter), active profile, reliable RSVP | Recognize, involve in leadership opportunities   |
| **Moderately Engaged** | Some attendance (1-2 events/quarter), profile exists                  | Maintain relationship, invite to relevant events |
| **At Risk**            | Was engaged, now inactive (no attendance 2+ months)                   | Personal outreach, understand barriers           |
| **New**                | Joined recently (<30 days)                                            | Onboarding focus, welcome personally             |
| **Inactive**           | No engagement for extended period (3+ months)                         | Low-touch periodic updates, respect preferences  |

### LLM vs. Rule-Based Scoring

**Recommendation:** Start with rule-based scoring, use LLM for edge cases and explanations.

- **Rule-based:** Deterministic, explainable, fast. E.g., "Highly Engaged = 3+ events in last 90 days AND profile updated in last 60 days"
- **LLM enhancement:** Generate natural language explanations, handle edge cases, suggest engagement strategies

## Notification Preferences Model

Research from MagicBell, Booster Hub, and SMS.to shows multi-channel communication requires granular preferences.

### Preference Dimensions

| Dimension                | Options                                              | Default      |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| **Event notifications**  | All events, Specific types only, Weekly digest, None | All events   |
| **Event types filter**   | Coworking, Reading groups, Workshops, Social, etc.   | All types    |
| **Notification timing**  | Immediately, Daily digest, Weekly digest             | Immediately  |
| **Notification channel** | Email, Push (future), SMS (future)                   | Email only   |
| **Reminder timing**      | 1 day before, 1 hour before, None                    | 1 day before |
| **Post-event follow-up** | Always ask, Never ask                                | Always ask   |

### Best Practices (from research)

- **Timing matters:** Post-event surveys within 2 hours get 42% more responses (Typeform)
- **Keep it short:** Attendance confirmation + 1-2 optional questions max
- **Respect preferences:** Aggressive notifications drive unsubscribes
- **Channel matching:** Different content types suit different channels (email for details, push for reminders)

## Post-Event Attendance Flow

Based on research from EventX, vFairs, Qualtrics, and Typeform.

### Recommended Flow

1. **Event ends** (or next day morning)
2. **Push notification / email:** "Did you attend [Event Name]?"
3. **One-tap response:** "Yes, I attended" / "No, I couldn't make it"
4. **If Yes:** Optional 1-2 question feedback
   - "How would you rate this event?" (1-5 stars)
   - "Any feedback?" (optional free text, max 280 chars)
5. **Thank you + next event suggestion**

### Key Insights

- **42% higher response** when sent within 2 hours (Typeform research)
- **Keep it under 2 minutes** - completion drops sharply after that
- **Star ratings > NPS** for event feedback (simpler, higher completion)
- **Mobile-first** - most responses come from phones
- **Don't require feedback** - attendance confirmation is the priority

## MVP Recommendation for v1.2

### Phase 1: Org Discovery + Basic Events

1. **Org discovery**
   - Geography-based org suggestions on profile/dashboard
   - Searchable org directory with location filter
   - Invite links (shareable URL that affiliates member with org)

2. **Event creation & listing**
   - Org admins can create events
   - Members see events from their orgs
   - Basic RSVP (Going / Not Going)

### Phase 2: Attendance + Notifications

3. **Post-event attendance flow**
   - "Did you attend?" notification after event
   - Optional simple feedback (star rating + text)
   - Attendance history visible on member profile

4. **Notification preferences**
   - Event notification frequency (all / digest / none)
   - Event type filtering
   - Reminder preferences

### Phase 3: Org CRM Dashboard

5. **Member directory**
   - Filterable member list for org admins
   - View member profiles (with privacy controls)
   - Basic stats (member count, career stage breakdown)

6. **Engagement scoring**
   - LLM-computed engagement levels
   - Admin override with notes
   - Simple engagement breakdown per member

7. **Export & affiliations**
   - CSV export of member data
   - Org-specific custom fields / affiliations

## Oxford OAISI Reference Mapping

How ASTN features map to Oxford OAISI's current Airtable CRM.
