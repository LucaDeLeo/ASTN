# Feature Ideas: AI Safety Talent Network

**Date:** January 22, 2026
**Goal:** Real impact, x-risk reduction through better career decisions, community integration, and time savings for talent and community managers.

---

## Core Philosophy

The AI Safety field is small, high-stakes, and time-constrained. Features should:
1. **Reduce friction** - Every click matters when people are busy saving the world
2. **Surface hidden information** - Make implicit knowledge explicit
3. **Build trust** - Honest about uncertainty, transparent about methodology
4. **Enable action** - Information without action paths is noise

## For AI Safety Talent

### 1. Career Path Visualization
**Problem:** People don't know what trajectories exist in AI Safety
**Solution:** Visual career maps showing:
- Common paths (academia → lab, industry → policy, self-taught → research)
- Real examples (anonymized with permission) of how people got where they are
- "You are here" indicator based on profile
- Suggested next steps with concrete actions

**Impact:** Reduces paralysis, shows viable paths, normalizes non-linear careers

### 2. Skill Gap Analysis Dashboard
**Problem:** "Your Growth Areas" is good but passive
**Solution:** Interactive dashboard showing:
- Gap between your profile and dream roles
- Specific courses, projects, or experiences to close each gap
- Progress tracking as you add new skills/experiences
- Estimated time investment for each development path

**Impact:** Transforms vague advice into actionable roadmaps

### 3. "Apply with Context" Feature
**Problem:** Applications go into black holes, no feedback
**Solution:**
- Generate personalized cover letter drafts highlighting match points
- Suggest which experiences to emphasize for each role
- Track application status (applied, viewed, interviewing, etc.)
- Post-rejection feedback collection (anonymized aggregate insights)

**Impact:** Higher quality applications, less wasted effort, learning from outcomes

### 4. Mentor Matching
**Problem:** Finding mentors in AI Safety is ad-hoc and network-dependent
**Solution:**
- Opt-in mentor pool with availability and expertise tags
- AI-assisted matching based on goals, background, and style preferences
- Structured mentorship programs (3-month check-in cycles)
- Micro-mentorship: one-time 30-min calls for specific questions

**Impact:** Democratizes access to guidance, reduces imposter syndrome

### 5. "What If" Career Simulator
**Problem:** Hard to evaluate trade-offs between different paths
**Solution:**
- Input two potential directions (e.g., "PhD vs. industry job")
- See expected outcomes: salary ranges, skill development, network access, research output potential
- Compare opportunity costs
- See examples of people who made each choice

**Impact:** Better-informed major career decisions

### 6. Opportunity Alerts with Intelligence
**Problem:** Good roles disappear before people see them
**Solution:**
- Real-time alerts for highly-matched opportunities
- "This one's special" flag for unusually good fits
- Deadline urgency indicators
- "X people you know applied" (with privacy controls)
- Predicted competition level based on posting characteristics

**Impact:** No more missed opportunities, strategic timing

### 7. Salary Transparency Index
**Problem:** AI Safety salaries are opaque, leads to bad negotiations
**Solution:**
- Anonymous salary submissions with verification
- Ranges by role, location, org type, experience level
- Cost-of-living adjusted comparisons
- Negotiation tips from successful examples

**Impact:** Fair compensation, informed decisions, reduced information asymmetry

### 8. Skills Endorsement System
**Problem:** Self-reported skills lack credibility
**Solution:**
- Peers can endorse specific skills (LinkedIn-style but better)
- Weight endorsements by endorser's credibility in that area
- Show "verified by" badges for demonstrated work
- Connect to public outputs (papers, code, posts)

**Impact:** Signal quality, help orgs identify true expertise

## For Community Managers

### 9. Community Health Dashboard
**Problem:** Managers fly blind on community engagement and needs
**Solution:**
- Member activity metrics (joins, profile updates, event attendance)
- Skill distribution heatmaps (what expertise does your community have?)
- Needs assessment (what are members looking for?)
- Engagement trends over time
- Churn prediction (who might disengage?)

**Impact:** Data-driven community management, early intervention

### 10. Talent Pipeline View
**Problem:** Hard to know who's ready for what opportunities
**Solution:**
- Filter community members by readiness for specific role types
- Track progression (who's developing which skills?)
- Identify "almost ready" candidates who need small pushes
- Warm intro facilitation tools

**Impact:** Efficient talent-opportunity matching, strategic development

### 11. Event Impact Tracking
**Problem:** Events happen but outcomes unclear
**Solution:**
- Post-event surveys with smart follow-up
- Track career outcomes correlated with event attendance
- "X attendees got jobs in Y months" metrics
- Networking success indicators
- Cost-per-outcome analysis

**Impact:** Justify resources, improve event design, demonstrate value

### 12. Community Comparison (Anonymized)
**Problem:** No benchmarks for what "good" looks like
**Solution:**
- Compare your community's metrics to similar communities
- "Your members get jobs X% faster than average"
- Identify best practices from high-performing communities
- Collaborative learning network for managers

**Impact:** Continuous improvement, shared learnings

### 13. Opportunity Broadcasting
**Problem:** Great opportunities don't reach right people
**Solution:**
- Post opportunities with target criteria
- Auto-match to relevant community members
- One-click "share to community" with context
- Track engagement and conversion

**Impact:** Efficient information distribution, less noise

### 14. Member Journey Mapping
**Problem:** Don't know what interventions help
**Solution:**
- Visual timeline of each member's engagement
- Key milestones (first event, first application, first job)
- Intervention logging (mentor connection, feedback session)
- Outcome attribution (what led to success?)

**Impact:** Understand what works, replicate successful patterns

## Final Thought

The AI Safety field doesn't have the luxury of inefficiency. Every person spinning their wheels on career decisions is a person not working on alignment. Every community manager doing manual matchmaking is spending hours that could go elsewhere.

ASTN should be the operating system for AI Safety careers — invisible when it works, invaluable when you need it, and constantly pulling the field toward better outcomes.

The moat is trust and data. Build both carefully.
