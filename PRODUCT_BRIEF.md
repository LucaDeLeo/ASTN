# AI Safety Talent Network (ASTN) — Product Brief

## What It Is

A career command center for people pursuing careers in AI safety. Users maintain living profiles and receive personalized opportunity matching with acceptance probability estimates and "what to do next" recommendations.

## The Core Insight

People keep profiles updated when they get real value back — not because you ask them to. ASTN's flywheel: smart matching and actionable recommendations motivate users to keep their profiles fresh, which improves matching quality, which delivers more value.

## Who It's For

**Three-sided network:**

1. **Individuals** — AI safety job seekers who want to find the right opportunities without drowning in listings
2. **Local Organizations** — Groups like BAISH (Buenos Aires AI Safety Hub) who need visibility into their community members' career journeys
3. **Opportunity Posters** — AI safety orgs who benefit from better-matched candidates (passive benefit initially)

## What Makes It Different

### Smart Matching with Explanations

Unlike black-box job boards, ASTN tells you _why_ an opportunity fits you — which specific skills, background elements, and interests align.

### Acceptance Probability Estimates

A novel feature: each match shows an AI-estimated likelihood of success, helping users prioritize where to focus their energy.

### Personalized Recommendations

Goes beyond "jobs for you" to actionable guidance: skills to develop, gaps to address, specific steps to improve fit for your target roles.

### Conversational Profile Building

Instead of tedious forms, users can have a natural conversation that extracts nuanced information about their background, goals, and interests.

### Self-Maintaining CRM

Local orgs get a dashboard that maintains itself — members update their own profiles because they're getting value, not because the org asks.

## Key Features

**For Individuals:**

- Rich profile creation via forms, document upload (resume/CV), or AI conversation
- AI safety-specific skills taxonomy (alignment research, governance, technical safety, etc.)
- Opportunity matching organized by fit tiers: Great, Good, Exploring
- Personalized "what to do next" recommendations
- Privacy controls (hide profile from specific orgs)
- Email digests with new high-fit matches

**For Organizations:**

- Member dashboard with profiles, activity, and aggregate stats
- Event integration (Lu.ma sync) with attendance tracking
- Engagement scoring to identify members who may need support
- Custom program tracking for workshops, reading groups, etc.
- CSV export for offline analysis

**Opportunity Aggregation:**

- Automated aggregation from 80,000 Hours job board and aisafety.com
- Freshness indicators ("Last verified: X")
- Search and filter by role type, location, experience level

## What It Doesn't Do

Intentionally excluded to stay focused:

- **No real-time messaging** — Avoids spam and cold outreach burden
- **No social feed** — EA Forum already serves community discussion
- **No gamification** — Mission-driven people don't need points; they need impact
- **No video interviews** — High friction for employed job seekers
- **No auto-apply** — Low-quality mass applications hurt everyone
- **No salary negotiation tools** — Out of scope for v1

## Current State

- **Pilot target:** BAISH (Buenos Aires AI Safety Hub), 50-100 initial profiles
- **Launch approach:** Workshop-based onboarding where members create profiles and get immediate matches during the session
- **Shipped versions:** v1.0 (MVP), v1.1 (document upload), v1.2 (org features + events), v1.3 (visual identity)

## The Vision

AI safety is a critical field with a talent shortage. ASTN aims to connect motivated individuals with the right opportunities faster, while giving community organizations the tools to support their members' career journeys — all without the friction and noise of generic job platforms.
